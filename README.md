# Pose Estimation:

Human pose estimation from video or a real-time feed plays a crucial role in various fields such as full-body gesture control, quantifying physical exercise, and sign language recognition. For example, it can be used as the base model for fitness, yoga, and dance applications. It finds its major part in augmented reality.

Media Pipe Pose is a framework for high-fidelity body pose tracking, which takes input from RGB video frames and infers 33 3D landmarks on the whole human. Current state-of-the-art approach methods rely primarily on powerful desktop environments for inferencing, whereas this method outperforms other methods and achieves very good results in real-time.

## Why do we need it:

With pose estimation, we’re able to track an object or person (or multiple people, as we’ll discuss shortly) in real-world space at an incredibly granular level. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of possible applications.

Pose estimation also differs from other common computer vision tasks in some important ways. A task like object detection also locates objects within an image. This localization, though, is typically coarse-grained, consisting of a bounding box encompassing the object. Pose estimation goes further, predicting the precise location of keypoints associated with the object.

We can clearly envision the power of pose estimation by considering its application in automatically tracking human movement. From virtual sports coaches and AI-powered personal trainers to tracking movements on factory floors to ensure worker safety, pose estimation has the potential to create a new wave of automated tools designed to measure the precision of human movement.
